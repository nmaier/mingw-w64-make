mingw-w64 Toolchain Makefile
===

I use this thing to build a mingw-w64 cross compiler (on OSX usually).

* Put this into a `build` subdirectory.
* Get the requirements ready and unpacked: gcc, binutils, mingw-w64 (and deps)
* Fiddle with the vars to match your needs.
* `make` (parallel make is not supported)

If it help fine. If it doesn't, then you can either provide a pull request to
fix things, or shut up about it ;)
